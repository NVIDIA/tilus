Installation
============

To install ``tilus``, you can use pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install tilus


If you want to install the latest development version, you can clone the repository and install it from source:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:hidet-org/tilus.git
    cd tilus
    pip install -e .

The ``-e`` option means "editable", so you can modify the source code and see the changes immediately without reinstalling.
